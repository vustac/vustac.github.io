# Project ideas for the Google Summer of Code

## Library summary generation

Develop library summaries that allow precise symbolic reasoning over library code without requiring full symbolic execution. Technologies such as machine learning and software repository mining are in-scope for this area.

## Automatically generate inputs that maximize loop bounds

The goal is to find "dangerous" inputs that, by maximizing loop bounds, cause the program to consume more system resources than intended.

## Improve overall scalability

This component involves the refactoring our instrumentation-based technique to offload as much as  possible to the native JVMTI agent.

## Improve string analysis

Improve the string analysis capabilities to allow scalable and precise reasoning of programs that use symbolic strings. This may include the integration of existing string theory solvers and/or the development of specialized lightweight string constraint solvers.
