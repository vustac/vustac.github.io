<h2 Library summary generation </h2>

Develop library summaries that allow precise symbolic reasoning over library code without requiring full symbolic execution. Technologies such as machine learning and software repository mining are in-scope for this area.

<h2> Automatically generate inputs that maximize loop bounds </h2>

The goal is to find "dangerous" inputs that, by maximizing loop bounds, cause the program to consume more system resources than intended.

<h2> Improve overall scalability </h2>

This component involves the refactoring our instrumentation-based technique to offload as much as  possible to the native JVMTI agent.

<h2> Improve string analysis </h2>

Improve the string analysis capabilities to allow scalable and precise reasoning of programs that use symbolic strings. This may include the integration of existing string theory solvers and/or the development of specialized lightweight string constraint solvers.
